# R24-25J-283 - Cyberseeds Growing the future of Agriculture with IT

## Overview Of The Project
Tea is one of Sri Lanka's most important agricultural exports, contributing significantly to the country's economy. However, the traditional methods of managing tea plantations are increasingly being challenged by environmental changes, labor shortages, and the need for more sustainable practices.
This research aims to revolutionize tea crop management by implementing a smart system that not only increases productivity but also ensures sustainability and meets global standards for environmental and social responsibility.

### IoT device to transmit real-time environmental factors and the mobile application to visualize.
The tea industry in Sri Lanka is a cornerstone of the nation’s economy, playing a critical role in 
employment and export revenue. However, the industry is grappling with significant challenges 
such as climate variability, inefficient resource management, and the absence of real-time data, all 
of which threaten tea production and quality. This project proposes the development of an Internet 
of Things (IoT)-based environmental monitoring system tailored for Sri Lankan tea plantations. 
The system utilizes advanced sensors to monitor key environmental parameters, including soil 
moisture & nutrition level, temperature, and humidity, which are vital to tea crop health and 
productivity.

### Predective digital twin model
This research aims to enhance the efficiency and productivity of tea plantations by developing a 
Predictive Digital Twin model. The model integrates advanced data analytics, satellite imagery, 
and real-time sensor data to optimize yield prediction and harvest scheduling. By dividing the 
plantation into blocks, the model provides precise predictions for yield and harvest times, enabling 
more efficient resource allocation and reducing operational costs. The digital twin also visualizes 
the plantation’s growth stages in a 3D environment, helping farmers make informed decisions 
based on accurate, real-time information. This study explores the potential of digital twins in 
agriculture, focusing on the specific application within tea plantations. The research contributes to 
the growing body of knowledge on smart farming, offering practical solutions for improving 
agricultural practices and sustainability in Sri Lanka’s tea industry. The findings have implications 
for broader agricultural contexts, potentially revolutionizing crop management practices globally.

### Visualize the real-time data of the IoT device in the digital twin and the carbon footprint tracking system.
This project aims to develop an advanced Digital Twin and Carbon Footprint Tracking System tailored for tea 
plantations in Sri Lanka. Leveraging IoT sensors, the system will collect real-time environmental data such as 
temperature, soil moisture, and CO2 emissions, which will be visualized in a 3D model using Unity. The Digital 
Twin will serve as a dynamic, virtual replica of the tea plantation, providing stakeholders with an immersive and 
interactive tool for monitoring and optimizing agricultural practices. In parallel, the system will incorporate a 
comprehensive Carbon Footprint Tracking module, designed to quantify and forecast the environmental impact of 
tea production. By integrating machine learning models, the project will predict future carbon emissions based on 
current trends and provide actionable insights for reducing the plantation's carbon footprint. Additionally, the project 
will implement a Product Passport system, secured by blockchain technology, to ensure transparency and 
traceability across the tea supply chain. The overarching goal of this project is to enhance the sustainability and 
efficiency of tea cultivation through innovative digital technologies, ultimately contributing to more environmentally 
responsible agricultural practices in Sri Lanka.

### Digital product passport integrate with the blockchain
The rapid evolution of technology in the agriculture industry presents an opportunity to significantly enhance 
product traceability, transparency, and consumer trust. This research focuses on the development of a 
blockchain-based digital product passport system tailored for the tea production industry. The proposed 
system is designed to address the growing demand for authentic and traceable product information, allowing
consumers to make informed choices.
The primary objective of this research is to create a robust and secure digital product passport system that 
leverages blockchain technology to store, manage, and verify all product-related data throughout its lifecycle. 
The implementation of this digital product passport system has shown significant improvements in product 
traceability and transparency. By providing consumers with direct access to detailed product information, the 
system fosters greater consumer confidence and trust in the authenticity and quality of the tea products. The 
research also highlights the advantages of using blockchain technology to secure data and prevent tampering, 
thereby enhancing the overall reliability of the information provided.
