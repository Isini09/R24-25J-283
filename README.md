# R24-25J-283 - Cyberseeds Growing the future of Agriculture with IT

## Overview Of The Project
Tea is one of Sri Lanka's most important agricultural exports, contributing significantly to the country's economy. However, the traditional methods of managing tea plantations are increasingly being challenged by environmental changes, labor shortages, and the need for more sustainable practices.
This research aims to revolutionize tea crop management by implementing a smart system that not only increases productivity but also ensures sustainability and meets global standards for environmental and social responsibility.
